If there are errors in the study of the words or suggestions for improvement, then let us know. This will make it possible to improve the application and our efforts will not disappear. I wish you a pleasant study<br>',
            2: 'To learn words, you can select several modes. When repeating learned words or learning all words, words will be provided in which mistakes were made in mini-games or words in which it was time for repetition. The time for repetition is set by the settings. Words fall into a specific group for repetition based on the number of errors  or using the corresponding buttons. Words with errors will be repeated until you study them or remove them from the study.'
